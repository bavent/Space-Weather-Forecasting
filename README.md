Feedforward Neural Networks and Elman Recurrent Networks are used to predict Dst values for k-hours into the future, using relevant past data about the system (Kyoto Index and ACE satellite data).

Future work will include results for more neural network architectures, as well as other machine learning methods for time-series regression.
